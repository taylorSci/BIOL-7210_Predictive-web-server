Copied from Georgia Tech BIOL 7210 (Spring 2021) course code. Students are permitted to share their work in other venues during & after the semester.

This is a [predictive web server](http://team1.predict2021.biosci.gatech.edu/) that includes genomics pipeline components from four previous class groups. I implemented the Django framework and called pipeline scripts therefrom. My teammates contributed in other ways including webpage design, pipeline script standardization, figure design, devops, wiki, etc.

This code was contributed to Team I. The course wiki can be found at https://compgenomics2021.biosci.gatech.edu/Main_Page.
